# Q-Car

An example of Q-Learning, where the agent learns to drive a car through a course. Inspired by the video from [CodeBullet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r428O_CMcpI). A pre-trained model is stored in NNdump which is loaded at startup. 
The Demo shows the actions from the Agent with the model in NNdump.
